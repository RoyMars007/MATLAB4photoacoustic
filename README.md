# MATLAB4photoacoustic

The collection contains MATLAB and Python code for photoacoustic image reconstruction using frequency-domain superposition (linear array, 3D, 2D)

These code snippets are designed to reconstruct the PA image of a linear array;

pressure_distribute = real(fftshift(ifftn(ifftshift(pressure_distribute))));

It may have application value in COMSOL secondary development and PA linear array reconstruction.
